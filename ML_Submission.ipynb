        "# **Project Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding salary trends in the technology industry has become increasingly important for job seekers, employers, recruiters, and policymakers in today’s competitive job market. With the rapid expansion of technology roles across various industries and geographies, compensation varies significantly based on job titles, company size, experience, and location. The objective of this project is to analyze a real-world dataset of job postings from Glassdoor (2017–2018) and develop a robust salary prediction system using machine learning. In addition to building a predictive model, the project focuses on uncovering patterns, trends, and insights that can help different stakeholders make informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes a variety of features such as job title, company name, salary estimate, rating, company size, location, headquarters, founded year, industry, sector, revenue, and competitors. These attributes play an essential role in determining how compensation varies across organizations and regions. As a first step, the project performs detailed data cleaning, addressing missing values, removing outliers, and converting unstructured salary ranges into meaningful numerical values. Important feature engineering steps like extracting company age, location-based state labels, and job description length further enhance the dataset, enabling deeper analysis and better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase focuses on identifying trends in salary variations across job titles, cities, company attributes, and industries. With the help of visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps, we analyze how salaries differ among roles like Data Scientist, Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and DevOps Engineer. The project also evaluates whether larger companies tend to offer higher compensation and how location impacts salary disparities, especially in tech hubs such as California, New York, and Washington. This phase helps validate key hypotheses, such as “Data Science roles earn more than traditional software roles” and “Company size and revenue contribute positively to salary levels.”\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing the EDA, the project transitions into predictive modeling. A set of supervised regression algorithms—including Linear Regression as a baseline and Random Forest Regressor as an advanced model—are trained to predict the average salary for a given job listing. Categorical features are encoded using OneHotEncoding, and numerical variables are processed appropriately to ensure smooth model training. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV is performed to optimize the Random Forest model for better accuracy and generalization. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model comparison reveals that Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning significantly outperforms Linear Regression, achieving higher prediction accuracy and capturing complex feature interactions. Additionally, feature importance analysis highlights the most influential factors affecting salary, such as job title, location, company size, rating, and industry type. These insights provide valuable information to stakeholders. Job seekers can better understand expected compensation ranges before applying for roles, employers can benchmark their salary offerings to stay competitive, and recruiters can attract top talent by setting appropriate salary bands. Policy analysts can also use the insights to study wage inequalities across industries and regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project highlights the power of machine learning in extracting meaningful salary trends from real-world job data. By combining effective data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and insight generation, the project delivers a comprehensive solution for salary prediction and market trend analysis. This analysis not only supports accurate compensation forecasting but also helps different stakeholders navigate the dynamic and fast-evolving tech job landscape with clarity and confidence."

        "The technology job market is highly dynamic, with salaries varying significantly across job roles, locations, company sizes, and industry sectors. Job seekers often struggle to understand what salary range to expect for a specific role, while employers and recruiters must continually benchmark compensation to remain competitive. Despite the availability of job postings on platforms like Glassdoor, the information is often unstructured, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret without analytical tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to analyze historical Glassdoor job posting data (2017–2018) and build a predictive machine learning model capable of estimating salaries for various tech job roles. This involves cleaning and transforming raw job posting attributes, extracting meaningful features, performing exploratory data analysis to uncover salary patterns, and applying regression algorithms to predict salary values accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project seeks to answer the following key questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "How do salaries differ across job positions such as Data Scientist, Software Engineer, or DevOps Engineer?\n",
        "\n",
        "What impact do company characteristics—such as size, rating, and revenue—have on salary levels?\n",

        "How do geographic factors influence compensation, particularly across major tech hubs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Which job attributes play the most significant role in determining salary?\n",
        "\n",
        "Can machine learning models generalize well enough to predict salary ranges for unseen job listings?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the problem is to transform unstructured compensation data into actionable insights and accurate predictions. The solution should help stakeholders—including job seekers, employers, recruiters, and analysts—better understand salary expectations, optimize hiring strategies, and make data-driven decisions in the competitive tech industry."
